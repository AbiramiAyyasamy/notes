# Cloud Concepts


## What is Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the pratice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.


## Six Advantages and Benefits of Cloud Computing
1. **Trade capital expense for variable expense** :

   **No upfront-cost** Instead of paying for data centers and servers
   **Pay On-Demand** Pay only when you consume computing resources

2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale** :

   Usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud. Your are **sharing the cost with other customers** to get unbeatable savings.

3. **Stop guessing capacity** :

   Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs, **Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers**, you can scale up or scale down to meet the current need.

4. **Increase speed and agility** :

   Launch resources **within a few click in minutes** instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT to implement the solution on-promise.

5. **Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers** :

   **Focus on your own customers**, rahter than on the heavy lifting of racking, staking, and powering servers.

6. **Go global in minutes** :

   Deploy you app in minutes in **multiple regions around the world with a few clicks**.
   Provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.


## Types of Cloud Computing
   1. **SaaS** : (For Customers, ex: gmail, office365,...) \
   Software as a service, a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
   2. **PaaS** : (For Developers, ex: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App engine,...) \
   Plateform as a service, removes the need for you organization to manage the underlying infrastructure. Focus on the deployment and management of yoAWS Elastic BeanstalkYou have an app, you push-it and it runs.
   1. **IaaS** : (For Admins, ex: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure,...)
   Infrastructure as a service, the basic building blocks for you cloud IT, Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space.


## Cloud Computing Deployment Models
   1. **Cloud** : Fully utilizing cloud computing \
   For Startups, SaaS offerings, New Projects and companies
   1. **Hybrid** : Using both Cloud and On-Promise \
   For Banks, FinTech, Investment Management, Large Professional Service providers, Legacy on-promise
   1. **On-Promise** : Dploying resources on-promises, using virtualization and resource management tools \
   For Public sectors eg. Government, Super Sensitive eg. Hospitals, large Entreprise with heavy regulation eg. Insurance Compagnies



# AWS Global Infrastructure


## Introduction and Map Overview
<p align="center">
   <img src="assets/aws_regions-1.png" width="600">
</p>

AWS now spans **77 Availability Zones** within **24 geographic regions** around the world, and has announced plans for nine more Availability Zones and three more AWS Regions in Indonesia, Japan, and Spain.

**Regions** : Physical location inthe world with multiple Availibity Zones \
**Availibity Zones** : One or more discrete data centers \
**Edge Location** : Datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS\


## Regions

A **geographysically distinct** location which has multiple datacenters (AZs)

Every region is **physically isolated** from and independent of other region in terms of location, power, water supply

Each region has **at least two AZs**

AWS largest ragion is **US-EAST**

New services almost always become availible first in **US-EAST**

Not all services are availible in all regions

**US-EAST** is the region where you see all your **billing information**

[More Information](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/?p=ngi&loc=2)


## Availability Zones

An AZ is a datacenter owned and operated by AWS in which AWS services run

Reach region has at least two AZs

AZs are represented by a Region Code, followed by a letter identifier eg. **us-east-1a**

**Multi-AZ** Distributing your instances across multiple AZs allows failover configuration for handling requests when one goes down.

< 10ms latency between AZs


## Edge Locations

An Edge Locaton is a datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS which has a **direct connection** to the AWS network.

These locations serve reqeuests for **CloudFront** and **Route 53**. Requests going to either of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automaticaly.

**S3 Transfer Acceleration** traffic and **API Gateway** endpoind traffic also use the AWS Edge Network.

This allows for low latency no matter where the end user is geographically located.


## GovCloud Regions

AWS GovCloud Regions allow customers to host sensitive **Controlled Unclassified Information** and other types of regulated workloads.

GovCloud Regions are only operated by employees who are U.S citizens, on U.S. soil.

They are **only** accessible to U.S. entities and root account holders who pass a screening process.

Customers can architect secure cloud solutions that comply with:
   - FedRAMP High baseline
   - DOJ's Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) Security Policy.
   - U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
   - Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
   - Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide.
