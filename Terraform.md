## What you need to know about infrastructure as code
Infrastructures code is provisioning infrastructure through **software** to achieve **consistent** and **predictable** environments

1. It is being done through software. It's not a manual process.
2. The goal is to achieve consistent, That means every time that you use this software to deploy infrastructure, it does it in a consistent way.
3. The environment you get at the end is a predictable environment. It doesn't leave you guessing, it's going to look exactly like the configuration files say it should look.


## IaC Code Concepts
in order to achieve the goal. There's some core concepts to talk about :

### Defined in code
This should be fairly obvious. But I feel like I need to say it anyway. Infrastructure as code is defined in code, you are going to be using configuration files that are using some sort of software and coding mechanism to define your infrastructure, and whether that format is json, yaml or Hash Corp configuration language infrastructure is code is going to be defined in code.

### Stored in source control
You should be storing that code somewhere in source control. The source control management that most people are familiar with is github, gitub uses git source control to store repositories of code. And that code is versioned, and multiple developers can work on it simultaneously.

### Declarative or imperative
